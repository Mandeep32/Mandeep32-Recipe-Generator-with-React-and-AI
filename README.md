Getting Started with Your React Project
This project was set up using Create React App.

Available Commands
In your project folder, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Starts the app in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see it live.

The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and any errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Starts the test runner in watch mode.
For more details, check the section about running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production into the build directory.
This command bundles the app and optimizes it for better performance, making it ready for deployment.

The output is minified, and filenames include hashes to optimize caching.

npm run eject
Important: This action is irreversible. Once you eject, you can't go back.

If you're not happy with the default configuration and build tools, you can eject at any time.
This command removes the single build dependency and places all configuration files (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

After ejecting, you’ll need to manage and update the configuration yourself. Most users won’t need to eject, as the default setup works well for small to medium projects.
